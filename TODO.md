- [ ] Inufuto conversion
    - [x] Dump the loader block to z80 assembly again (inufuto-loader.asm)
    - [x] Figure out where the game is copied to in RAM
        - Seems to be $8800 (see the first couple bytes after c9c9c9c9...)
    - [x] Do an equivalent copy-to-RAM, but from-ROM instead
    - [x] Figure out why it is just crashing and restarting?
    - [ ] Figure out how to set 2-screen mode
        - [x] Set up an experiment to diff the memory dumps between 1 and 2 page
        - [x] Yewdow tape and ROM are both setting 2 page mode I believe, how are they doing that?
            - looks like the source to yewdow is out there. chead.asm is involved
            - Startup.asm has the brains? no comments to help me
                - loads from $fa27
                - sets some kind of bitflag on out port $0d (vram bank)
                - overwrites 512 bytes from $c000 as $8c
                - $fa2d seems to be key click
            - [x] Should I record the Yewdow ROM's write to work area ($fa00+)?
            - [x] Is Yewdow even setting 2 pages? How do we know?
                - Yewdow isn't even a 32K game!!!
        - [x] Yewdow tape works when converted, probably because it's a 16K game and doesn't go too far outside of $8800?
            - [x] How long is it? 8766
            - [x] How long is Lift? 7644. so that's not it.
                - [ ] Is Lift trying to overwrite itself?? entry point is $403d
                    - $13b3 (BIOS) is trying to overwrite $a000 which is part of the game
        - [x] Are there any other Inufuto games on ROM? (Yes, ASCEND)
        - [ ] What is BASIC doing when it comes up? Run it up to $4004, turn on logging, and then do different runs with a cartridge and without to compare what happens (has to be page 2)
            - Games affected: Lift, Aerial, Neuras, Ruptus (all 32K games?)
    - [ ] Write a test cart with this loader
    - [ ] Burn a real cart with this loader
    - [ ] How do you change count of screens from assembly?
