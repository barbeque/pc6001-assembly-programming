- [ ] Inufuto conversion
    - [x] Dump the loader block to z80 assembly again (inufuto-loader.asm)
    - [x] Figure out where the game is copied to in RAM
        - Seems to be $8800 (see the first couple bytes after c9c9c9c9...)
    - [x] Do an equivalent copy-to-RAM, but from-ROM instead
    - [ ] Write a test cart with this loader
    - [ ] Burn a real cart with this loader
    - [ ] How do you change count of screens from assembly?
